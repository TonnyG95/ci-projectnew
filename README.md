# Testing

## Responsive Desing

Testing was done in a few steps. Designs were done first for mobile devices using chrome dev tools. I check all of my pages on every device that the dev tool can emulate. Staring from devices with 280px screens to 4K. 1080p 1440p and 4K was natively checked.

## Code

Code was checked with the W3C HTML validator and W3C CSS validator to ensure that there were no problems with my code and that my code met all standards.
